    <span class="highlight">A Study of Stray: By Ryan Klement</span>
    <br><br>
    <p>I will be taking a deep dive into the 3rd-person game "Stray", and how the audio supports or contrasts the dystopian environments set to be traveled by our furry little friend.</p>

    <p>After viewing the trailer, we are initially greeted with an ominous backing track, immediately setting the scene as more eerie rather than cute or cuddly, which is what the expectations are from the audience when seeing an adorable cat on the cover of the game. This creepy score is then followed by the 3rd POV of our protagonist walking in a dark and wasted alleyway, with the NPCs frantically running away.</p>

    <p>Here is a closer look at some of the characters we see in this trailer:</p>

    <!-- Image Row -->
    <div class="image-row">
      <!-- Left Image with Text -->
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="Stray Cat.jpg" alt="Stray Cat">
        <p>Our unnamed protagonist! We play as him traveling through a cyberpunk world to get back home to his family.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Center Image with Text -->
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="Robot Stray.jpg" alt="Robot Stray">
        <p>These NPCs come in all sorts of styles, personalities, and interactions for our protagonist along the way.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Right Image with Text -->
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="Zurks Stray.jpg" alt="Zurks Stray">
        <p>One of the main antagonists of the game, the <span class="bold-text">Zurks</span> are an evolved bacteria set out to attack anyone in its path!</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Blueprint: Here I will include specific examples, one being the chase scene, the quests in the town, and the art of retrying at save points through the story. Perhaps some details about lighting, must mostly focused on the musical aspects of the game.
    This is where I will provides maybe a picture, along with video of certain attributes (robot music scene). Finally, I will cite my sources.</p>
