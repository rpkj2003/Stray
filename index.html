    <span class="highlight">STRAY</span>
    <br><br>
    <p>A deep dive into the audio and visual elements of the 2022 PlayStation Game of the Year winner, and how BlueTwelve Studio aimed to venture beyond the scope of a typical indie game.</p>
    
    <p><span class="highlight">What is <span class="bold-text">Stray</span>?</span></p>

    <p>Stray is a game where you follow an orange tabby cat through a dystopian world, that is full of life, but not in the way you'd expect. Pounce, jump, and run as you avoid pitfalls, traps, and enemies, all while searching for your way back home to your feline family.</p>
    
    <p><span class="highlight">What's At Stake?</span></p>

    <p>Not only is your life (or lives) at stake, the entire population you encounter relies on your actions. As you progress further into the game, you uncover the mysteries of the overgrown land you find yourself in, all the while deadly zurks, sentinels, cliffs, and of course, water, stand in your way. Try your best to not get caught, or you may as well kiss your nine lives goodbye.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">What's the Narrative Arc?</span></p>

    <p>The journey begins as you and your littermates get ready for bed during a thunder storm under a concrete overhang. Upon waking up, you begin your journey in search of food, water, and to quinch your thirst for exploration. However, following your littermates of a rust pipeline, it collapses, resulting in you falling a signifcant height, separated from your family. Your job as you wake back up is to find your way back home! Following your adventure, you encounter all of sorts of interesting figures: robots. These robots have personalities, and they send you on quests, with the hopes of either personal gain, or to help you along your way. During your adventure, one particular robot becomes your greatest friend/ally, and his name is B-12. Continuing on your adventure, you both unravel the mysterious of this strange world, escaping from your enemies to get to the final challenge: opening the city walls. By sacrificing B-12, you are able to venture beyond the city limits, and return to nature.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">How Does it End?</span></p>

    <p>The game ends as you finally reach the high tech facility with the controls to open the city walls to the rest of the world; you are what changes the future of this once unknown robot civilization. However, no ending is ever satisfying without sacrifice, as B-12 says his last goodbyes, he sacrifices himself to override the processors capable of opening the wall to city 99. As the city is shown a new light, our feline friend exits the once forgotten city, and the game ends with us returning to the wild, continuing our search for our furry family.</p>

    <p>After viewing the trailer, we are initially greeted with an ominous backing track, immediately setting the scene as more eerie rather than cute or cuddly, which is what the expectations are from the audience when seeing an adorable cat on the cover of the game. This creepy score is then followed by the 3rd POV of our protagonist walking in a dark and wasted alleyway, with the NPCs frantically running away.</p>

    <p>Here is a closer look at some of the characters we see in this trailer:</p>

    <p>Blueprint: Here I will include specific examples, one being the chase scene, the quests in the town, and the art of retrying at save points through the story. Perhaps some details about lighting, must mostly focused on the musical aspects of the game.
    This is where I will provides maybe a picture, along with video of certain attributes (robot music scene). Finally, I will cite my sources.</p>
