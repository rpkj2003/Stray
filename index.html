    <p>I will be taking a deep dive into the 3rd-person game "Stray", and how the audio supports or contrasts the dystopian environments set to be traveled by our furry little friend.</p>

  <p>After viewing the trailer, we initially are greeted with an ominous backing track, immediately setting the scene as more eerie rather than cute or cuddly, which is what the expectations are of the audience when seeing an adorable cat on the cover of the game. This creepy score is then followed by the 3rd POV of our protagonist walking in a dark and wasted alleyway, with the npc's frantically running away.</p>
<p>Here is a closer look at some of the characters we see in this trailer:</p>
